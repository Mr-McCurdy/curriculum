# **Tips for Solving These Exercises**

1. **Understanding Formulas:**
   - **Mean of Sampling Distribution of $\hat{p}$:** $\mu_{\hat{p}} = p$
   - **Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution of $\hat{p}$:** $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$
   - **Mean of Sampling Distribution of $\bar{x}$:** $\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu$
   - **Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution of $\bar{x}$:** $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
   - **Central Limit Theorem:** States that the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\bar{x}$ will be approximately normal if the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large (commonly $n \geq 30$), regardless of the population distribution.

2. **Normal Approximation Conditions for Proportions:**
   - The normal approximation is appropriate if both $np \geq 10$ and $n(1-p) \geq 10$.

3. **Calculating Probabilities:**
   - Use z-scores to find probabilities associated with specific ranges in a normal distribution.
   - **Z-Score Formula:** $z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$

4. **Interpreting Z-Scores and Probabilities:**
   - Z-scores indicate how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.
   - Probabilities tell us the likelihood of a value falling within a certain range in a normal distribution.

5. **Verifying Sample Size Requirements:**
   - Ensure that your sample size meets the criteria for applying normal approximations to sampling distributions of proportions.

6. **Using Standard Normal Distribution Tables or Calculators:**
   - For probability calculations, refer to z-tables or use statistical calculators to find the area under the curve corresponding to z-scores.
