## Unit 4: Probability

### **Question 1**
A factory produces light bulbs, and the probability that any given bulb is defective is \( p = 0.02 \). The quality control manager selects a random sample of 100 bulbs for inspection.

**a.** What is the probability that exactly 2 bulbs in the sample are defective?

**b.** What is the probability that at most 2 bulbs in the sample are defective?

**c.** The manager claims that the defect rate is less than 2%. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level to evaluate this claim. Use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.

## Unit 5: Sampling Distributions

### **Question 2**
A researcher is studying the average number of hours college students spend studying per week. The population standard deviation is known to be \( \sigma = 5 \) hours.

**a.** If a sample of 64 students is taken, what is the standard error of the sample mean?

**b.** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean if the sample mean is \( \bar{x} = 32 \) hours.

**c.** Interpret the confidence interval in the context of this study.

## Unit 6: Inference for Means

### **Question 3**
A company claims that the mean lifetime of its batteries is at least 500 hours. To test this claim, a random sample of 36 batteries is tested, and the sample mean lifetime is found to be 485 hours with a sample standard deviation of 20 hours.

**a.** State the null and alternative hypotheses for testing the company's claim.

**b.** Calculate the test statistic using the t-test.

**c.** Determine the p-value and conclude whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the company's claim at the 5% significance level.

**d.** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean lifetime of the batteries.

**e.** Based on the confidence interval, what can you conclude about the company's claim?

## Unit 7: Inference for Proportions

### **Question 4**
In a survey of 500 voters, 275 indicated that they support Candidate A for mayor.

**a.** Construct a 99% confidence interval for the proportion of all voters who support Candidate A.

**b.** The candidate claims that more than 50% of voters support them. Using the confidence interval, assess the validity of this claim.

**c.** Perform a hypothesis test at the 1% significance level to determine if the proportion of supporters is greater than 50%.

## Unit 6: Comparing Means

### **Question 5**
Two different teaching methods are being compared to determine their effectiveness on student performance. Method X was used on a sample of 25 students with a mean score of 78 and a sample standard deviation of 10. Method Y was used on a sample of 30 students with a mean score of 82 and a sample standard deviation of 12.

**a.** State the null and alternative hypotheses to test if there is a significant difference in mean scores between the two methods.

**b.** Calculate the test statistic for the hypothesis test assuming unequal variances.

**c.** Determine the degrees of freedom using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation.

**d.** Find the p-value and conclude whether there is a significant difference in mean scores at the 5% significance level.

**e.** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means.

## Unit 7: Comparing Proportions

### **Question 6**
A pharmaceutical company claims that their new drug cures at least 70% of patients. In a clinical trial, 150 patients were treated with the drug, and 105 were cured.

**a.** State the null and alternative hypotheses to test the company's claim.

**b.** Calculate the test statistic using the z-test for proportions.

**c.** Determine the p-value and conclude whether there is sufficient evidence to support the company's claim at the 5% significance level.

**d.** Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of patients cured by the drug.

**e.** Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the pharmaceutical company's claim.
