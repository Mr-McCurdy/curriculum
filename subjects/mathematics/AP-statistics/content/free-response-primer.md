## Problem 1

Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be scored on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy and completeness of your results and explanations.

A farm produces olive oil that is put into bottles that are sealed with a cork. The diameter of the bottle opening is 1.03 inches. To provide an acceptable fit, the cork diameter should be from 0.99 inch to 1.03 inches. The corks are purchased in bulk from a supplier, and the distribution of cork diameters is approximately normal with mean 1.00 inch and standard deviation 0.05 inch.

#### 1.a
If one cork is selected at random, what is the probability that the cork selected will provide an acceptable fit for the bottle? Show your work.

#### 1.b
A farm manager decides to purchase the corks from a new supplier. Seventy percent of corks produced by the new supplier have a diameter with an acceptable fit. The farm manager is investigating how many corks in a box of 20 randomly selected corks will provide an acceptable fit. Consider the probability that **at least 19** of the corks will provide an acceptable fit for the bottle.

##### 1.b.i
Define the random variable of interest and state how the random variable is distributed.

##### 1.b.ii 
What is the probability that **at least 19** of the corks will provide an acceptable fit for the bottle? Show your work.

#### 1.c
Suppose corks are inspected one at a time until an acceptable fit is found. Let the random variable $W$ represent the number of corks inspected. What is the probability that $W$ is less than or equal to 2? Show your work.

### Solution

#### 1.a

To determine the probability that a randomly selected cork has a diameter between **0.99 inch** and **1.03 inches**, we can use the properties of the normal distribution.

1. **Define the Random Variable:**
   - Let **X** be the diameter of a randomly selected cork.
   - **X** is normally distributed: $$X \sim N(\mu = 1.00, \sigma = 0.05)$$.

2. Standardize the Values:
   We convert the raw scores to **z-scores** using the formula:

$$
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$
   
   - For **X = 0.99 inches**: $$z_1 = \frac{0.99 - 1.00}{0.05} = \frac{-0.01}{0.05} = -0.2$$
   
   - For **X = 1.03 inches**: $$z_2 = \frac{1.03 - 1.00}{0.05} = \frac{0.03}{0.05} = 0.6$$

3. **Find the Probabilities Using the Standard Normal Distribution Table:**
   
   - **P(Z < 0.6):**
     From the z-table, $$P(Z < 0.6) \approx 0.7257$$.
   
   - **P(Z < -0.2):**
     From the z-table, $$P(Z < -0.2) \approx 0.4207$$.
   
   - **Probability Between Z = -0.2 and Z = 0.6:**
    
$$
P(-0.2 < Z < 0.6) = P(Z < 0.6) - P(Z < -0.2) = 0.7257 - 0.4207 = 0.3050
$$
   
4. **Interpret the Result:**
   
   The probability that a randomly selected cork has an acceptable diameter is **30.50%**.

**Answer:**
The probability of a chosen cork being an acceptable fit for the bottle is **30.50%**.

#### 1.b

##### 1.b.i

1. **Define the Random Variable:**
   
   - Let **X** represent the number of corks with an acceptable fit in a box of **20** randomly selected corks.

2. **Determine the Distribution:**
   
   - Each cork has two outcomes: acceptable fit (success) with probability **p = 0.70**, and unacceptable fit (failure) with probability **q = 1 - p = 0.30**.
   
   - The selection of corks is independent.
   
   - **X** follows a **Binomial Distribution**: $$X \sim \text{Binomial}(n = 20, p = 0.70)$$.

**Answer:**  
Let **X** be the number of corks with an acceptable fit in a box of 20. **X** is binomially distributed with parameters **n = 20** and **p = 0.70**, denoted as $$X \sim \text{Binomial}(20, 0.70)$$.

##### 1.b.ii 

1. **Identify the Desired Probability:**
   
   We need to find $$P(X \geq 19)$$, which includes $$P(X = 19) + P(X = 20)$$.

2. **Use the Binomial Probability Formula:**
   
   The probability of exactly **k** successes in **n** trials is: $$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}$$
   
   $P(X = 19) = \binom{20}{19} (0.70)^{19} (0.30)^{1} = 20 \times (0.70)^{19} \times 0.30$
   
   $P(X = 20) = \binom{20}{20} (0.70)^{20} (0.30)^{0} = 1 \times (0.70)^{20} \times 1 = (0.70)^{20}$

3. **Calculate the Probabilities:**
   
   $P(X = 19) = 20 \times (0.70)^{19} \times 0.30 \approx 0.00683933711122$
   
   $P(X = 20) = (0.70)^{20} \approx 0.000797922662976$

   $P(X \geq 19) = P(X = 19) + P(X = 20) \approx 0.00683933711122 + 0.000797922662976 = 0.0076372597742$

4. **Interpret the Result:**
   
   The probability that at least **19** corks out of **20** have an acceptable fit is approximately **0.7637%**.

**Answer:**  
The probability that at least 19 corks provide an acceptable fit is approximately **0.7637%**.

#### 1.c

1. **Define the Random Variable:**
   
   - Let $$W$$ be the number of inspections needed to find the first acceptable cork.
   
   - Since each inspection is independent and has a probability of success $$p = 0.70$$, $$W$$ follows a **Geometric Distribution**: $$W \sim \text{Geometric}(p = 0.70)$$.

2. **Understand the Probability Asked:**
   
   $$P(W \leq 2)$$ is the probability that the first acceptable cork is found on the **first** or **second** inspection.

3. **Calculate $$P(W \leq 2)$$:**
   
   $P(W = 1) = p = 0.70$
   
   $P(W = 2) = q \times p = 0.30 \times 0.70 = 0.21$
   
   $P(W \leq 2) = P(W = 1) + P(W = 2) = 0.70 + 0.21 = 0.91$

4. **Interpret the Result:**
   
   There is a **91%** probability that an acceptable cork will be found within the first two inspections.

**Answer:**  
The probability that $$W$$ is less than or equal to 2 is **0.91** or **91%**.

### **Summary of Answers**

   **1.a:** Probability = **0.3050** or **30.50%**

   **1.b.i:** $$X \sim \text{Binomial}(20, 0.70)$$

   **1.b.ii:** Probability = **0.005346** or **0.5346%**

   **1.c:** Probability = **0.91** or **91%**

| **Cash Prize**, $x$ | $1 | $5 | $10 | $20 | $50 | $100 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Probability of the cash prize, $P(X=x)$ | $P(X = 1)$| 0.2 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.01 | 0.01 |

##### 2.a.i 

Calculate the proportion of bath fizzies that contain at least $10.

#### 2.b

Based on the probability distribution of $X$, calculate the probability that a randomly selected bath fizzy contains $100, given that it contains atleast $10. Show your work.

#### 2.c

Based on the probability distribution of $X$, calculate and interpret the expected value of the cash prize in the bath fizzies. Show your work.

#### 2.d 

The Fizzy Bath Company would like to sell the bath fizzies in France, where the currency is euros. Suppose the conversion rate for dollars to euros is 1 dollar = 0.89 euros. Using your expected value from part (c), calculate the expected value, in euros, of the distribution of the cash prize in the bath fizzies. Show your work.

### Solution

#### 2.a

##### 2.a.i 

The sum of all probabilities for any probability distribution must equal 1:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) = 1.
$$

Therefore,

$$
P(X = 1) = 1 - P(X \geq 2) = 1 - (0.20 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.01 + 0.01) = 0.68.
$$

##### **2.a.ii** 
   
   We need to find the probability that a bath fizzy contains \$10 or more. Mathematically, this is represented as:
   
   $$
   P(X \geq 10) = P(X = 10) + P(X = 20) + P(X = 50) + P(X = 100) = 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.12 
   $$

#### **2.b**

**Define the Conditional Probability:**
   
We need to find $P(X = 100 \mid X \geq 10)$, which is the probability that a bath fizzy contains $100 given that it contains at least $10.

**Use the Conditional Probability Formula:**
   
$$
P(X = 100 \mid X \geq 10) = \frac{P(X = 100 \text{ and } X \geq 10)}{P(X \geq 10)}
$$
   
Since $X = 100$ is a subset of $X \geq 10$, the formula simplifies to:
   
$$
P(X = 100 \mid X \geq 10) = \frac{P(X = 100)}{P(X \geq 10)}
$$

**Extract the Required Probabilities:**
   
From the table:
   
$$
P(X = 100) = 0.01
$$

$$
P(X \geq 10) = 0.12 \quad \text{(from part 2.a.ii)}
$$

**Calculate the Conditional Probability:**
   
$$
P(X = 100 \mid X \geq 10) = \frac{0.01}{0.12} \approx 0.0833
$$

**Interpret the Result:**
   
There is approximately a **8.33%** probability that a bath fizzy contains $100 given that it contains at least $10.

#### **2.c**

The expected value $E(X)$ of a discrete random variable $X$ is calculated as:
   
$$
E(X) = \sum_{x} x \cdot P(X = x) = (1 \times 0.68) + (5 \times 0.20) + (10 \times 0.05) + (20 \times 0.05) + (50 \times 0.01) + (100 \times 0.01) = 4.68
$$

The expected value of the cash prize in the bath fizzies is **\$4.68**. This means that on average, a customer can expect to receive \$4.68 per bath fizzy purchased.

#### **2.d**

The Fizzy Bath Company would like to sell the bath fizzies in France, where the currency is euros. Suppose the conversion rate for dollars to euros is 1 dollar = 0.89 euros. Using your expected value from part (2.c), calculate the expected value, in euros, of the distribution of the cash prize in the bath fizzies. Show your work.

**Solution:**

1. **Define the Conversion Rate:**
   
   \[
   1 \text{ dollar} = 0.89 \text{ euros}
   \]

2. **Use the Expected Value from Part 2.c:**
   
   \[
   E(X) = \$69.65
   \]

3. **Convert the Expected Value to Euros:**
   
   \[
   E(X \text{ in euros}) = E(X \text{ in dollars}) \times \text{Conversion Rate}
   \]
   \[
   E(X \text{ in euros}) = 69.65 \times 0.89 = 62.1385 \text{ euros}
   \]

4. **Interpret the Result:**
   
   The expected value of the cash prize in euros is approximately **â‚¬62.14**. This means that on average, a customer purchasing a bath fizzy in France can expect to receive â‚¬62.14 per bath fizzy.

**Answer:**  
The expected value of the cash prize in euros is approximately **â‚¬62.14**.
