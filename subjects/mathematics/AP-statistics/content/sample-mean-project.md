# **Statistics Project: Analyzing Student Heights**

## **Project Overview**

In this project, you and a partner will collect and analyze data on the heights of students at Pacifica High School. This hands-on activity will help you understand the concepts of random sampling, data collection methods, and basic statistical measures such as the sample mean and sample standard deviation.

## **Objectives**

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. **Understand and apply** the principles of random and representative sampling.
2. **Differentiate** between measured and self-reported data collection methods.
3. **Calculate** and interpret the sample mean and sample standard deviation.
4. **Communicate** your findings effectively in a written report.

## **Project Instructions**

### **1. Form Groups**

- **Groups of 2:** Pair up with one other student to complete this project.

### **2. Data Collection**

- **Sample Size:** Select **30 random students** from Pacifica High School.
  
- **Ensuring Randomness and Representativeness:**
  
  - **Random Selection:** Describe the method you used to randomly select your 30 students. Examples include:
    - Using a random number generator to select student IDs.
    - Drawing names from a hat.
    - Selecting every nth student from an alphabetized list.
  
  - **Representativeness:** Ensure that your sample reflects the diversity of the student body in terms of grade levels, gender, ethnicity, etc. Explain how your sampling method achieves this.
  
- **Recording Heights:**
  
  - **Measured Heights:** If you chose to measure heights, describe the tools and procedures you used (e.g., using a measuring tape, ensuring consistent measurement conditions).
  
  - **Self-Reported Heights:** If you collected self-reported heights, explain how you solicited this information (e.g., through a survey or questionnaire) and discuss any potential biases this method might introduce.

### **3. Data Analysis**

**Calculate the Sample Mean ($\bar{x}$):**
  
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$
  
where $n = 30$ and $x_i$ represents each individual height.
  
**Calculate the Sample Standard Deviation ($s$):**
  
$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$
  
where \( n = 30 \) and \( x_i \) represents each individual height.
  
**Interpretation:**
  
- Discuss what the sample mean and sample standard deviation tell you about the distribution of student heights.
  
- Compare your findings to any known averages or standards, if available.

### **4. Report Writing**

Prepare a comprehensive report that includes the following sections:

#### **a. Introduction**

- **Objective:** Briefly describe the purpose of the project.
  
- **Importance:** Explain why understanding the distribution of student heights is relevant or interesting.

#### **b. Methodology**

- **Sampling Method:**
  
  - Detail the process you used to ensure that your sample of 30 students was both **random** and **representative** of the Pacifica student body.
  
- **Data Collection:**
  
  - Explain how you recorded the heights of the students.
  
  - Discuss any challenges faced during data collection and how you addressed them.

#### **c. Results**

- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  
  - Present the **sample mean ($\bar{x}$)** and **sample standard deviation ($s$)**.
  
  - Include any tables or charts that help visualize the data distribution (e.g., histogram, box plot).
  
- **Calculations:**
  
  - Show the step-by-step calculations for both the sample mean and sample standard deviation.
  
  - Use LaTeX formatting for all mathematical expressions to ensure clarity.

#### **d. Discussion**

- **Analysis:**
  
  - Interpret the calculated statistics. What do they reveal about the student heights at Pacifica?
  
- **Sampling Method Evaluation:**
  
  - Assess the effectiveness of your sampling method in achieving randomness and representativeness.
  
  - Discuss any limitations or potential sources of bias in your study.
  
- **Data Collection Method Evaluation:**
  
  - Reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of the data collection method you used (measured vs. self-reported).
  
  - Suggest ways to improve data accuracy and reliability in future studies.

#### **e. Conclusion**

- Summarize the key findings of your project.
  
- Highlight the importance of proper sampling and data collection methods in statistical analysis.

#### **f. References**

- Cite any sources you used to support your methodology, calculations, or analysis.
