       "### **1. Normal Distribution**\n",
       "\n",
       "The **Normal Distribution** is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve, symmetric about the mean. It is defined by two parameters:\n",
       "- **Mean ($\\mu$)**: The central value around which the data is distributed.\n",
       "- **Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$)**: Measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### **Key Properties:**\n",
       "- **Symmetry**: The distribution is symmetric around the mean.\n",
       "- **Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)**:\n",
       "  - **68%** of the data falls within $\\mu \\pm \\sigma$.\n",
       "  - **95%** within $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$.\n",
       "  - **99.7%** within $\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma$.\n",
       "- **Total Area Under the Curve**: Equals 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### **Standard Normal Distribution:**\n",
       "A special case of the normal distribution with:\n",
       "- **Mean ($\\mu$)**: 0\n",
       "- **Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$)**: 1\n",

       "To convert any normal distribution to the standard normal distribution, use the **z-score** formula:\n",

       "- **Between two values**: $P(a < Z < b) = P(Z < b) - P(Z < a)$\n",
