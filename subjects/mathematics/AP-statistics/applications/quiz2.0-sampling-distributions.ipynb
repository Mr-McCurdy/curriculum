      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of statistics, **hypothesis testing** is an essential tool for making inferences about population parameters based on sample data. By systematically evaluating evidence, hypothesis tests enable researchers and analysts to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions. This tutorial focuses on two fundamental hypothesis tests:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **1-Sample t-Test for Population Mean**\n",
      "2. **1-Sample z-Test for Population Proportion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, we will explore how these tests interrelate with **confidence intervals**, enhancing your ability to interpret and apply statistical findings effectively. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to conducting these tests manually, utilizing z-score and t-score tables, without the aid of calculators or statistical software.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method that allows us to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: A statement of no effect or no difference, serving as the default or starting assumption.\n",
      "- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$ or $H_1$)**: A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, indicating the presence of an effect or difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence in the sample data to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Components:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Significance Level ($\\alpha$)**: The probability threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, commonly set at 0.05 (5%).\n",
      "2. **Test Statistic**: A standardized value calculated from sample data, used to decide whether to reject $H_0$.\n",
      "3. **Critical Value(s)**: The cutoff point(s) on the test statistic distribution, beyond which we reject $H_0$.\n",
      "4. **P-Value**: The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample, assuming $H_0$ is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-Sample t-Test for Population Mean\n",
      "\n",
      "The **1-sample t-test** is used to determine whether the mean of a single population differs significantly from a known or hypothesized population mean. This test is particularly useful when the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) is unknown and the sample size is small ($n < 30$).\n",
      "\n",
      "### **When to Use:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Estimating the population mean when $\\sigma$ is unknown.\n",
      "- Comparing a sample mean to a known value.\n",
      "- Assessing the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Assumptions and Preconditions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before conducting a 1-sample t-test, certain assumptions must be met to ensure the validity of the test. These assumptions are based on the population parameters ($\\mu$) and the sample data:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Random Sampling**: The sample must be randomly selected from the population, ensuring that each member has an equal chance of being included.\n",
      "2. **Normality**: The population from which the sample is drawn should be approximately normally distributed. For smaller samples ($n < 30$), the normality assumption is critical. For larger samples, the Central Limit Theorem allows for some deviation from normality.\n",
      "3. **Independence**: Observations should be independent of one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** The assumption of normality is verified using the population parameter $\\mu$. If the population distribution is known to be normal or the sample size is sufficiently large, the normality condition is satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Steps to Perform a 1-Sample t-Test by Hand:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **State the Hypotheses:**\n",
      "   \n",
