        <summary><strong>ðŸ”Ž Hint</strong></summary>

    ##### We need to find the probability that a bath fizzy contains \$10 or more.

    ##### Mathematically, this is represented as: 

    $$P(X \geq 10) = P(X = 10) + P(X = 20) + P(X = 50) + P(X = 100) = 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.12$$

    ##### Therefore, the proportion of bath fizzies that contain at least \$10 is 0.12 or 12%.

2. $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$

    <details>
        <summary><strongðŸ”Ž Hint</strong></summary>

    To factor the quadratic equation, look for two numbers that multiply to **+6** and add up to **-5**.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><strong>ðŸ’¡ Answer</strong></summary>

    $x = 2$ and $x = 3$
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><strong>SðŸ”“ Solution</strong></summary>

    **Step 1:** Identify two numbers that multiply to **+6** (the constant term) and add up to **-5** (the coefficient of the middle term).
    
    **Step 2:** The numbers **-2** and **-3** satisfy these conditions since:
    
    \(-2 \times -3 = +6\)  
    \(-2 + (-3) = -5\)
    
    **Step 3:** Rewrite the quadratic equation using these numbers:
    $$
    x^2 - 2x - 3x + 6 = 0
    $$
    
    **Step 4:** Factor by grouping:
    $$
    x(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0
    $$

    **Step 5:** Factor out the common term \((x - 2)\):
    $$
    (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0
    $$

    **Step 6:** Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
    $$
    x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
    $$
    $$
    x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
    $$

    **Conclusion:** The solutions are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).

### Problem 2
**Simplify the expression:**
$$
\frac{\tan(\theta)}{1 + \cot(\theta)}
$$

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
  
Start by expressing \( \tan(\theta) \) and \( \cot(\theta) \) in terms of sine and cosine:
$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} \\
\cot(\theta) = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}
$$

Substitute into the original expression:
$$
\frac{\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}}{1 + \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} \div \left( \frac{\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} \right) = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)(\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta))}
$$

Simplify by factoring:
$$
\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} \cdot \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta)} = \tan(\theta) \cdot \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta)}
$$

Final simplified form:
$$
\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)(\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta))}
$$

### Problem 3
**Prove that \( \tan(\theta) + \cot(\theta) = \frac{2}{\sin(2\theta)} \).**

<details>
  <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
  
Start with the left-hand side (LHS):
$$
\tan(\theta) + \cot(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} + \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}
$$

Recall the double-angle identity for sine:
$$
\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sin(2\theta)}{2}
$$

Substitute into the LHS:
$$
\frac{1}{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)} = \frac{2}{\sin(2\theta)}
$$

Therefore:
$$
\tan(\theta) + \cot(\theta) = \frac{2}{\sin(2\theta)}
$$
